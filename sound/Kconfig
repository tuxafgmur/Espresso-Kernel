	  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
	  the modular sound system is contained in the files
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/Introduction>.  The file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> contains some slightly
	  outdated but still useful information as well.  Newer sound
	  driver documentation is found in <file:Documentation/sound/alsa/*>.

config SOUND_OSS_CORE
	bool
	default n

config SOUND_OSS_CORE_PRECLAIM
	bool "Preclaim OSS device numbers"
	depends on SOUND_OSS_CORE
	default y
	help
	  With this option enabled, the kernel will claim all OSS device
	  numbers if any OSS support (native or emulation) is enabled
	  whether the respective module is loaded or not and try to load the
	  appropriate module using sound-slot/service-* and char-major-*
	  module aliases when one of the device numbers is opened.  With
	  this option disabled, kernel will only claim actually in-use
	  device numbers and opening a missing device will generate only the
	  standard char-major-* aliases.

	  The only visible difference is use of additional module aliases
	  and whether OSS sound devices appear multiple times in
	  /proc/devices.  sound-slot/service-* module aliases are scheduled
	  to be removed (ie. PRECLAIM won't be available) and this option is
	  to make the transition easier.  This option can be overridden
	  during boot using the kernel parameter soundcore.preclaim_oss.

	  Disabling this allows alternative OSS implementations.

	  Please read Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt for
	  details.

	  If unsure, say Y.
