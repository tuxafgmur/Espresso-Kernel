menuconfig FB
	tristate "Support for frame buffer devices"
	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.munted.org.uk/programming/Framebuffer-HOWTO-1.3.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

         This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique
	 where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas
	 the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the
	 default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed
	 parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.
	 For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,
	 an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a
	 rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in
	 terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.

	 If unsure, say N.
